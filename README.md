Introducing the EASE Starter App for Wordpress for Small Business

The EASE Starter App for Wordpress is designed to make it fast and easy for you to get your small business website hosted on Google App Engine; and at the same time give you the flexibility to customize it and integrate it with services like Google Docs and Spreadsheets on the backend.

What is the starter app and what does it do?

The EASE Starter App for Wordpress includes a number of prebuilt pages that set up a website for you and your business in minutes. Installation is just copy and paste the source files, one name change, and you're ready to deploy using your Google App Engine account. From there you will walk through a wizard and a series of templates to set up your style and integrate your Google Docs and Spreadsheets.
What features does it include?

What is EASE Core Framework?
Cloudward's EASE Core Framework is a software platform that runs on Google App Engine, supporting the EASE scripting language. EASE is used to enhance HTML markup, and is designed to take the hard part out of creating web apps for the cloud - that is, the need to code for more complex programming tasks, such as interfacing with databases, storing data with 3rd party services (google docs spreadsheets, etc.), managing sessions and cookies, and other elements that make writing web apps for the cloud complex.

Why use EASE?
EASE does many things that would generally be implemented in a web app by utilizing a procedural or object-oriented programming language, but it should be noted that EASE in itself is not a programming language in those classical senses. You canâ€™t create loop structures or define functions (this is lower level programming stuff). EASE simply provides new tags that are processed by the EASE Core Framework by parsing the HTML at request time. EASE tags, in conjunction with EAS managing your data, allow for dynamic web content with very little coding.
